# G.A.L-by-xxxnightvoidxxx-Gamers-As-Legions-
Gamers.As.Legions [Gaming/System-Optimizer] [G.A.L] For Windows 10/11 

If it says "Python 3.x," you’re good. If not, uninstall and try again. You’re not ready for G.A.L if you can’t even install Python.

---

STEP 3: RUN THE INSTALLER
- Double-click `install.bat` to start the installation.
- If you’re lucky, everything’s already set up, and G.A.L will launch automatically.
- If not, the installer will guide you through the rest. Pay attention, or you’ll miss something important.

---

STEP 4: SIT BACK AND LET THE MAGIC HAPPEN
- The installer will check for dependencies, upgrade pip, and install everything you need.
- If it asks for admin privileges, give it. You’re not in control here.
- Once it’s done, G.A.L will launch. If it doesn’t, you probably messed something up. Try again.

---

STEP 5: JOIN THE LEGION
- Congratulations, you’ve installed G.A.L. You’re now part of something bigger than yourself.
- If you encounter issues, check the `GAL_Install_Debug.log` file for clues. Don’t come crying to me if you didn’t read it.

---

NOTES:
- Keep `G.A.L.pyw` and the other files in the same folder. Don’t move them unless you know what you’re doing.
- If you force reinstall (because you’re paranoid), edit `install.bat` and set `FORCE_INSTALL` to 1. But don’t blame me if things break.
- Also, if you want to delete d bugs.... Do it!

---

Now go forth, gamer. The legion awaits.
