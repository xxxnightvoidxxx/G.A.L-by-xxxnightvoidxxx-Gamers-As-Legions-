G.A.L - Gamers As Legions
Installation Guide

STEP 1: CHECK YOUR PYTHON
GLaDOS (Portal):
"Before you even think about installing G.A.L, check your Python version. Type python --version in your terminal. If it says ‘Python 3.x,’ congratulations, you’re not a complete failure. If not, uninstall whatever abomination you have and try again. You’re not ready for G.A.L if you can’t even install Python. I’m not angry, just disappointed."

STEP 2: RUN THE INSTALLER
Handsome Jack (Borderlands):
"Alright, cupcake, double-click Run.bat to start the installation. If you’re lucky—and let’s face it, you’re probably not—everything’s already set up, and G.A.L will launch automatically. If not, the installer will guide you through the rest. Pay attention, or you’ll miss something important. And trust me, you don’t want to mess this up. I’m watching you."

STEP 3: SIT BACK AND LET THE MAGIC HAPPEN
Trevor Philips (Grand Theft Auto V):
"The installer will check for dependencies, upgrade pip, and install everything you need. If it asks for admin privileges, give it. You’re not in control here, buddy. Once it’s done, G.A.L will launch. If it doesn’t, you probably messed something up. Try again, but this time, don’t be such a bleeping idiot."

STEP 4: JOIN THE LEGION
Vaas Montenegro (Far Cry 3):
"Congratulations, you’ve installed G.A.L. You’re now part of something bigger than yourself. Do you know what that is? It’s the legion. If you encounter issues, check the GAL_Install_Debug.log file for clues. Don’t come crying to me if you didn’t read it. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?"

NOTES:
Cayde-6 (Destiny):
"Listen up, Guardian. Keep G.A.L.pyw and the other files in the same folder. Don’t move them unless you know what you’re doing. If you force reinstall—because you’re paranoid or just like living on the edge—edit Run.bat and set FORCE_INSTALL to 1. But don’t blame me if things break. Also, if you want to delete debug logs... do it! You’re welcome."

NOW GO FORTH, GAMER
Duke Nukem (Duke Nukem):
"The legion awaits, and so does your destiny. You’ve got the tools, you’ve got the power, and now you’ve got G.A.L. It’s time to kick inefficiency in the ass and chew bubblegum. And guess what? I’m all outta gum. Let’s rock."
